# MonitorRAM
I am a user of a PC with low RAM and well when using the OS System Monitor to see the evolution of my RAM I noticed that this last uses a significant part of the RAM; so I created this script to see the evolution of RAM only with a slight consumption of resources.
## Use :
First you should to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/HamzaGbada/MonitorRAM.git
```
Then you have to change the `main.sh `file execution rights
```
chmod +x main.sh
```
Finally , you need only to execute it :
```
./main.sh
```
